      <p>
        Welcome to DLCM. The following are just a few suggestions about what you
        should do once you have created your account.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Update your profile</strong> - Upload an avatar and add your
        redemption link and location.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Create your first release</strong> - Click the create new
        release button and enter your release information. Click create to add
        your first release.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Add some codes</strong> - Now that you have a release, click the
        add codes button. Copy the codes from your file, and paste them into the
        text box. If you have the pro version, you could also add codes by
        uploading the bandcamp provided CSV file. When you click add, these
        codes will now be ready to be dispersed amongst your adoring fans. Great
        Job!
      </p>

      <p>
        Thatâ€™s really all there is to it. As mentioned above, you can subscribe
        to our pro version for even more features and unlimited releases.
